As part of an online assessment test on HackerEarth, I took on the challenge of building a dynamic and user-friendly application that allows book enthusiasts to manage their personal libraries effortlessly. Now that the hackathon has concluded, I'm excited to open-source the project and share it with all of you on GitHub and LinkedIn!

📖 Key Features:

Intuitive Book Management: Users can seamlessly add books to their virtual bookshelves, providing details such as book name, ISBN number, category, quantity, cost, and availability.

Edit and Delete Functionality: The Bookshelf App empowers users with the ability to edit or remove books from their collection, ensuring maximum flexibility and control.

Effortless Search: Looking for a specific book? The app allows users to search by book name or ISBN number, making it easy to find and organize their literary treasures.

💻 Tech Stack:

I built this application using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a smooth and modern user experience:

React JS: Powering the front end for a dynamic and responsive interface.
JavaScript: The backbone of the application, providing functionality and interactivity.
Tailwind CSS: Styling the app with a clean and aesthetic design.
React Redux Toolkit: Managing state efficiently for a seamless user experience.
👨‍💻 Why Open Source?

I believe in the power of collaboration and learning from one another. By open-sourcing this project, I hope to contribute to the developer community and inspire others to explore the world of React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. Feel free to check out the code on GitHub and let me know your thoughts and suggestions!

🙏 Acknowledgments:

A big shoutout to HackerEarth for providing a platform that fuels innovation and challenges developers to push their boundaries.
